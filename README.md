Project IronCore is an open source system for managing compute and storage workloads across multiple providers.

The API does not have any tight coupling to Kubernetes core container workloads.

“Project IronCore” is focused on a Kubernetes driven IaaS and is neither affiliated or sponsored by “IronCore Labs” nor 
related to its GitHub page, nor its content under https://github.com/IronCoreLabs.
